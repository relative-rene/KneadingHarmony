<h2> About Jason Lee</h2>
<h3>Vision<h3>
<p>I am running a private practice to maintain flexability to provide quality healing sessions. I focus on meeting your relaxation desires while looking out for your body's needs.
Tour De Force Productions also introduces massage into timeslots: music festivals, private parties, and venues.
Longterm I plan to open a large-scale healing center where an intergrated approach to health and well being is offered: massage, energy work, meditation, excercise, goal setting, and life coaching.
I am also working to develop a non-profit to bring basic touch to children in orphanages here in San Francisco and in third world countries.

<h3>Practices<h3>
<p>I worked at Burke Williams Spa part time in San Francisco to support my growing personal practice for over 3 years 2010-2014.</p>

<h3>Spirituality</h3>
I consider myself a Unitarian Universalist with an Eastern Philosophical emphasis and grounded in Quantum Physics.  I was raised by Buddhist parents, have Mormon grandparents, and have explored many religions personally.
I have taken academic World Religions classes, but learned more in traveling to other countries than in a classroom. I have worked in Mother Theresa's orphanage alongside the Sisters, meditated for a month in a Thai Monastery, shaken the Dalia Lama's hand, and taught country line dancing in a Mormon Hall.  All of these experiences have been formative.
Most recently, I have re-experienced my spirituality in studying massage.  I often feel waves of energy pass through me and feel that it is a true expression of a universal energy available to us all.  I choose not to assign a label to the source.

<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>
I grew up in Forestville, CA North of San Francisco and went to college just South.  Most of my life has been spent in the wonderful Bay Area with it's cultural diversity and natural beauty.
However, I have traveled relatively extensively throughout Asia and the Americas. Travel has included: Nepal, India, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, Belize, Peru, and Thailand again! Most recently I have traveled to Europe visiting London, Amsterdam, Prague, Karlovy Vary, Munich, the Bavarian Alps, Barcelona, Cordoba, and Malaga.
I visited world class European spas and Hamams while there!
I also have been a fair amount of places in the US.
This l has helped broaden my world view, exposed me to different religious and cultural perspectives, and given me a sense of connectedness beyond my daily life here in California.

RESPECT FOR CLIENT NEEDS AND BOUNDARIES
<li>Knead Love massage therapists are happy to adjust pressure, temperature, music volume, work longer on
an area or move on if you request it.</li>
<li>The client may choose to: leave on as much clothing as needed for comfort, refuse any massage methods, stop
massage at any time and is free to leave; the therapy door is never locked.</li>
<li>The client will always be draped. Only the area(s) being worked on will be undraped. The clients will be kept
informed of the area to be massaged.</li>
<h2>PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES</h2>
<li>Low back, hip and gluteal area can be worked through the draping, rather than undraped, if requested. Any area
can be avoided, if requested.</li>
<li>Sexual interaction or discussion of any kind between the client and the massage therapist is NEVER appropriate.
Requests for sexual activity will not be tolerated, will be viewed as solicitation and reported to the proper
authorities under the guidelines of the massage therapy policies and procedures. The client will not be rescheduled
if this occurs.</li>
<li>On rare occasions an involuntary sensual response to massage is natural and will subside on its own.</li>
<h2>CONFIDENTIALITY AND CONVERSATION</h2>
<li>We treat all client visits and conditions as confidential. The client may or may not choose to talk during the
massage.</li>
<h2>EXISTING AND NEW MEDICAL CONDITIONS</h2>
<li>It is the responsibility of the client to keep the massage therapist informed of any medical treatment currently
being taken, and to provide written permission from the physician, chiropractor, physical therapist, etc., that
massage therapy sessions may be continued.</li>
<li>The client must also keep the massage therapist informed of any changes in health conditions.
The terms and conditions of this agreement are binding. I, _______________________________, hereby acknowledge
that I have read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions listed above.
